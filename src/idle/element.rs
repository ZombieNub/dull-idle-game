/*
This is the general element code. The game is made up of game elements, each of which needs to be stored and kept track of.
This general code contains things which are common across all elements, which are currently only UI features.
Specifically, they are window_id and is_open, which directly interact with egui's window system.
The window_id is used to identify the window, and is_open is used to determine whether the window is open or not.
